/*
 *  Balanced Brackets
A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., ( , [ , or { ) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, ( , and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ] .
By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met: It contains no unmatched brackets.
The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
Given strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES . Otherwise, return NO .
Function Description
Complete the function isBalanced in the editor below. It must return a string: YES if the sequence is balanced or NO if it is not.
isBalanced has the following parameter(s): s: a string of brackets
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer , the number of strings.
Each of the next lines contains a single string , a sequence of brackets.
Constraints
, where is the length of the sequence. All chracters in the sequences âˆˆ { {, }, (, ), [, ] }.
Output Format
For each string, return YES or NO . Sample Input
3
{[()]} {[(])} {{[[(())]]}}
Sample Output
YES NO YES
                                                            
 Explanation
  1. The string {[()]} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
2. The string {[(])} is not balanced because the brackets enclosed by the matched pair { and } are
not balanced: [(]) .
3. The string {{[[(())]]}} meets both criteria for being a balanced string, so we print YES on a new line.
